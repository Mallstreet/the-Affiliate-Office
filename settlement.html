      <h2>Important: Discover Settlement for Overcharged Merchants</h2>
      <p>
        If your business accepted or processed Discover credit card transactions between 2007 and 2023, you may be eligible for compensation due to a class action settlement. Discover Financial Services has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle claims that it misclassified consumer credit cards as commercial cards, leading to higher interchange fees for merchants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have imposed penalties and required Discover to make restitution to affected merchants. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>
      <p>
        To assist merchants in registering for the settlement, Finance Pro+ is offering support through their platform.
